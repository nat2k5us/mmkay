Step 1: 
Create the Data Contract for example Route will be (Tip - Copy an existing entity in DataContracts and Rename)
[DataContract]
public class Route : EntityBase, IIdentifiableEntity, IAccountOwnedEntity 
{
	[DataMember]
	public int RouteId {get; set;}

	// More data members as needed
}

Step 2:
Create the Service Contract (Tip - Copy an existing Service in Service Contracts and Rename)
[ServiceContract]
public interface IRouteService
{
	[OperationContract]
	Route GetRoute(int id);

	[OperationContract]
	IEnumerable<Route> GetRoutes();

	// Add more Operations as needed
}

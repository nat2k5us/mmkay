# Welcome to the Dream Project

Why is this project called a dream?

Because we all want to do something that will realize the dream - a dream to create a product that will help us get out of the rat race .

What is the product we want to create?

Again we are open to Ideas - but we all want to start some where - if nothing let this serve as a repository of libraries that are capable of a dream. The product realization can come later.
